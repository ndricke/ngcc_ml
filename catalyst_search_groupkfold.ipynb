    "The most conspicuous constraint is to find a set number of active catalysts without any unnecessary DFT calculations\n",
    "What is unnecessary? --> 100% of O2 binding calculations are to actual binding sites\n",
    "So we can accept a model with lower accuracy as long as it has no false positives --> only a small penalty for false negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we're only willing to run 5 DFT O2 binding calculations, and we want basically all of them to show that we found active sites. We'd probably want each of these to be per catalyst, to show that we've found 5 unique active catalysts. Assuming we're working with 10% of the data as a \"test\" set, that's about 27 calalysts, so we want to pick the ones that the model is most confident have at least 1 site that binds O2.\n",
